# fees Dashboard

The task to manage and keep the fee-related document for 4 years is difficult for both the administration and students. Since the era is moving towards digitization, so the process of paying has greatly shifted to online mode, and thus tracking any particular payment without any Unique-Id payment is way more cumbersome and hectic. So in that case, if somehow any party either admin or student lost the hard copy of that receipt, then the process becomes difficult to verify the fees that either the total fees are submitted or not. So, the fee dashboard is a tool designed for managing student fee receipts and the verification process. It provides an efficient way for students to track their fee payments and for administrators to easily verify and manage these receipts. This solution aims to simplify the fee receipt management process and make it smoother for students and the admins involved. It stores the fee receipt uploaded by a student in the cloud in the default pending state, those references are added to the pool of pending queue which can be seen on the admin verify panel only, to change the state to either approved or reject state if true. The admin also has a page to upload the semester fees once a year means the current session the admin use is unique. So this has shifted the whole process online and since it is online hence can be handled from anywhere.
